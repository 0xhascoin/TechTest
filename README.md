1) I have worked with API's before on several projects:

  1a) https://github.com/hasanelmi678/TravelAdvisor - A web app that lets advises users on resteraunts, hotels and attractions in locations that you are         travelling to. - Uses the Google maps API, RapidAPI (Travel Advisor API & Weather Map API).
  
  1b) https://github.com/hasanelmi678/Cryptoverse - A web app that lets users track cryptocurrency price details and news articles from 50+ different             sources. - Uses RapidAPI - Crypto API, RapidAPI - Bing News Search API.
  
  1c) https://github.com/hasanelmi678/Realestateapp - A real estate website for properties in the United Arab Emirates.
      - Uses RapidAPI - UAE Real Estate API.
      
      
2) The way I'll approach this task is by first returning data from the API, next looking at the data and the key values that I will need for the rest of      the task, such as the date of each launch. Then finally once I have a good understanding of the data I can then decide how I would like to present it in    calendar UI.

3) Given more time I would improve the UI and make it so that I can display more information about each launch without clogging up all the space in the        calendar. I would also, include some images of each of the separate rockets and maybe add the price of each launch.
